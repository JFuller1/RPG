# Enter the Consolegeon
The final project for my Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals course, in which we were tasked with making a simple console-based RPG. 
This console RPG includes fights, a dungeon the player can navigate, special rooms and more. 
To play, download the repository and run it in visual studio or any equivalent.
